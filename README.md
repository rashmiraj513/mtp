# MTP Repository

This repository contains all the implementation code of the research paper [Edge-Enabled Two-Stage Scheduling Based
on Deep Reinforcement Learning for
Internet of Everything](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OtO-1gzLaATz-aPwzLuXz6zn-OIyYVQf/view?usp=drive_link) for the Master's Term Project (MTP) for the Master's degree from IIT Patna.

## How to setup

1. Create a virtual environment with the following command:
   > For this, you need to install `venv` package if not installed already.

```bash
python -m venv <virtual_env_name>
```

2. Once virtual environment is created, you need to activate it. Go to the root folder in which your virtual environment is created and type this command:

```bash
source <virtual_env_name>/Scripts/activate
```

3. After activating virtual environment, install the dependencies by the following command:

```bash
python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. After successfully completing above steps, you can open `main.ipynb` and run it manually.

> Note:
>
> - Replace the `virtual_env_name` with your virtual environment name.
> - The file `requirements.txt` contains all the dependencies for this repository to run.
